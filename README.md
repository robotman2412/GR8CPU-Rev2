# GR8CPU-Rev2

My second CPU project, orderable as a kit!

The instruction set ROMs are in the folder "IS"<br>
The programs along with the exported files are in the folder "programs"<br>
The program i used to generate the instruction set ROMs is in the folder "ISGEN"<br>
Take a look at [creating-an-is.md](../master/ISGEN/creating-an-is.md) for a guide on how to create an instruction set.

The assembler creates a folder called "data", which stores the paths.<br>
It is recommended you keep this, but not necessary.<br>
To start writing programs, download the repository and use assembler.jar to assemble your programs.<br>
I also made a guide on how to create programs in [assembler.md](../master/assembler.md)
