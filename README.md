# GR8CPU-Rev2

My second CPU project, orderable as a kit!

The instruction set ROMs are in the folder "IS"<br>
The programs along with the exported files are in the folder "programs"<br>
The program i used to generate the instruction set ROMs is in the folder "ISGEN"<br>
Take a look at "CTRL" and "ASMGV2" for an example on how to generate an instruction set.

The assembler creates a folder called "data", which stores the paths.<br>
It is recommended you keep this, but not necessary.

Note: I must still make a full guide on instruction sets later.
